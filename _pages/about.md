I'm a first-year computer science master's student at [Concordia University](https://concordia.ca), advised by [Sudhir P. Mudur](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~mudur/). My reaseach focuses on developing machine learning algorithms, mainly focused on self-supervised learning, video representation learning, knowledge distillation, and continual learning.

Also, Iâ€™m an enthusiastic developer in big data space, experienced in machine learning and data mining as well as design and development of data models, data warehouse and data lake solutions, and distributed data-processing/analytics systems.
